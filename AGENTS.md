# AI Agent Entry Point

Detailed AI instructions and reusable custom Storefront Layout material live
in the dedicated [`.ai-agent/`](.ai-agent/) directory so they stay separate
from application source.

For tasks that customize, redesign, audit, package, or publish this Storefront
as a custom Selldone Layout, read these files completely:

1. [`.ai-agent/AGENTS.md`](.ai-agent/AGENTS.md)
2. [`.ai-agent/SKILL.md`](.ai-agent/SKILL.md)
3. [`.ai-agent/AI_WORKFLOW.md`](.ai-agent/AI_WORKFLOW.md) when GitHub setup,
   dependency synchronization, packaging, authentication, or deployment is in
   scope

The official Vue 3/Vite Storefront is the implementation baseline. This kit
does not authorize a framework replacement or a parallel storefront app; the
visual design may change completely while the platform and commerce contracts
remain intact. Do not change the official repository's Git remote model or run
release commands merely because this shim exists. Apply publication rules in
the owner's controlled clone, fork, or release branch.
